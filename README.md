# Simple-Calculator
This is a Simple Calculator project which I made by using python programming language for some basic operations like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication etc. This project helped me to learn a lot of new things to apply in my projects like real world concepts of mathematics, the calculator even deals with some graphic user interface.
